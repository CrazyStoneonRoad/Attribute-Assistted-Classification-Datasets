# Attribute-Cooperated-Classification-Datasets
## Contents
Three ***Attribute-Cooperated-Classification-Datasets*** **(ACC Datasets)** are built based on three existing classficiation datasets:
- **AC-AID** based on AID [1] and RSICD [4]
- **AC-UCM** based on UCM [2] and Caption [5]
- **AC-Sydney** based on Sydney [3] and Caption [5]

## Attribute Type Lists for ACC Datasets
The [Attribute Type List](https://github.com/CrazyStoneonRoad/Attribute-Cooperated-Classification-Datasets/blob/master/Attribute_List.md) shows attribute types and the counts for these attribute types.
There are three groups in the Table. The first two columns are about AC-AID, the second two columns are about AC-UCM, and the third two columns are about AC-Sydney. 

# Citations
If you find the ACC Datasets usesful, please cite the following articles.
