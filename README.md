# Attribute-Assistted-Classification-Datasets
## Contents
Three ***Attribute-Assistted-Classification-Datasets*** **(AACDs)** are built based on three existing classficiation datasets:
- AC-AID based on AID
- AC-UCM based on UCM
- AC-Sydney based on Sydney

- NO.Images

Number of images in the dataset.

- SIZE.Images

Size of images in the dataset.

- NO.Classes

Number of image classes in the dataset.

- **NO.Attributes**

Number of all attribute items in the dataset. 
Note that in an image, there maybe several attribute items from all items.

- NO.Images per Class

Number of images in each class.

- **NO.Images per Attribute**

Number of images corresponding to each attribute item.
